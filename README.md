# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project implements a Twitter sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories and determine the overall sentiment of the dataset by summing individual sentiment scores. Enhanced text preprocessing and feature extraction techniques are employed to improve sentiment categorization.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.6 or higher. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
    cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - On Windows:

        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install the required packages:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset:**

    Ensure you have a dataset of tweets in CSV format. The dataset should have at least one column containing the tweet texts.

2. **Run the sentiment analysis script:**

    ```sh
    python sentiment_analysis.py --input tweets.csv --output results.csv
    ```

    Replace `tweets.csv` with the path to your dataset file and `results.csv` with the desired output file name.
